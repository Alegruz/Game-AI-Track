# Advanced C/C++
Effective C++ : 55 specific ways to improve your programs
and designs, 3rd edition<br>
by Scott Meyers
<br>RECOMMENDED<br>
best practice book<br>
This was written with the aim of being the best second book C++ programmers should read, and it succeeded. Earlier editions were aimed at programmers coming from C, the third edition changes this and targets programmers coming from languages like Java. It presents ~50 easy-to-remember rules of thumb along with their rationale in a very accessible (and enjoyable) style. For C++11 and C++14 the examples and a few issues are outdated and Effective Modern C++ should be preferred.
