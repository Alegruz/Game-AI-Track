# Exercises

## 1.1

Explain why professional software that is developed for a customer is not simply the programs that have been developed and delivered.

Software includes all the additional stuffs like documents, etc. needed for the developers, publishers to use during development, release.

## 1.2.

What is the most important difference between generic software product development and custom software development? What might this mean in practice for users of generic software products?

In the generic products, the organization that develops the software controls the software specification. For custom products, the specification is developed and controlled by the organization that is buying the software.

## 1.3.

Briefly discuss why it is usually cheaper in the long run to use software engineering methods and techniques for software systems.

Because software engineering methods and techniques also deals with after services such as continuous quality assurance, reaction to societal / technical changes, it is more likely to react to changes and evolutions. Thus, it is usually cheaper in the long run to use software engeering methods and techniques.

## 1.4.

Software engineering is not only concerned with issues like system heterogeneity, business and social change, trust, and security, but also with ethical issues affecting the domain. Give some examples of ethical issues that have an impact on the software engineering domain.

Recent issue would be autonomous driving. If a car should give make a decision where any decision can lead into a human damage, which decision should the car choose? Decision that involves least human damage? or the decision that involves least driver damage?

## 1.5.

Based on your own knowledge of some of the application types discussed in Section 1.1.2, explain, with examples, why different application types require specialized software engineering techniques to support their design and development.

When developing mobile applications in a start-up company, the goal was to provide users with new functionalities as soon as possible. Thus frequently we reused codes, especially open-sourced ones, and also bought libraries / APIs to reduce development budget and schedule.

But when developing game engine, we developed everything from scratch including containers. Game engine development was more about providing usable, user-friendly interface but also strong in performance, efficient product.

## 1.6.

Explain why the fundamental software engineering principles of process, dependability, requirements management, and reuse are relevant to all types of software system.

Development must be accompanied with a managed and understood development process. The developing software should behave as expected without failures, and should be available for use when it is required. It should be safe in its operation and, as far as possible, should be secure against external attack. The system should perform efficiently and should not wast resources. The organization must know what differnet customers and users of the system expect from the software, and they have to manage their expectations so that a useful system can be delivered within budget and to schedule. They should also make effective use of existing resources by appropriately reusing software that has already been developed rather than write new software.

## 1.7.

Explain how electronic connectivity between various development teams can support software engineering activities.

Electronic connectivity such as mails, WhatsApp, Slack etc. provides route that the teams can communicate in real-time, thus they can react to some changes as quickly as possible.

## 1.8.

Noncertified individuals are still allowed to practice software engineering. Discuss some of the possible drawbacks of this.

This might affect the fundamental principle of software engineering such as "dependability". Because the individual him/herself has no reliability, this unreliability could naturally be transferred to the product.

## 1.9.

For each of the clauses in the ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics shown in Figure 1.4, propose an appropriate example that illustrates that clause.

1. Public
	* If public wishes a product that is eco-friendly, software engineering should take eco-friendly development process as one of the critical criteria.
2. Client and Employer
	* If both client and employer, and the public are interested in diversity, then it the software must also incorporate the notion of diversity.
3. Product
	* If the client / employer request 100, then the engineer should meet the request, and probably surpass it.
4. Judgment
	* If the public / client / employer opinion runs into somewhere that is unethical, then the developer should maintain intergrity and independence in their professional judgment.
5. Management
	* If there exist a way that solves a problem perfectly, but in a unethical way, engineer should seek for another way that might not solve the problem perfectly, but is ethical.
6. Profession
	* If public opinion goes against for example, military expansion or nuclear development, then one should rethink about joining such projects.
7. Colleagues
	* Engineer should treat their colleagues and espcially, their followers fairly to ensure just organization.
8. Self
	* What was ethical approach or standardized approach before might not be the case now.

## 1.10.

The “Drone Revolution” is currently being debated and discussed all over the world. Drones are unmanned flying machines that are built and equipped with various kinds of software systems that allow them to see, hear, and act. Discuss some of the societal challenges of building such kinds of systems.

Drones affect the aerial control of the country, lifecycle of the natural environment, privacy issues. Drones flying near airports might crash into the aircraft causing damage. Drones flying near for example, a natural park might scare off other birds or preys on the ground. Commercial drones often accompanies hi-resolution cameras that can cause privacy issues by surveillance.

Also, drones have shown that they are destructive weapon at war. This became trivial when the Armenia-Azerbaijan War broke out with Azerbaijan using Turkish drone weapon and the Afghanistan Civil War where Paskistani Special Force's drone weapon helped Taliban to demolish rebels at Panjshir.
