Function defintions should not be put in a header file. (function prototypes, macro defintions, type defintions could be put in a header file)

If a header file includes a definition rather than prototypes,
it means that every single file that is linked to the header file,
whether they are just using the header file's macros, typedefs etc.,
they are obligated to compile the function.

Every time the function is used everywhere, compiler must compile the
same function everytime, which causes error in linking stage
where linker expects a single definition of the same function.
