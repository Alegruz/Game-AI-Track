a. const int can't always be used as the value of a case label in a switch statement.
   if const int is declared in a certain scope, or say a function using a variable,
   we will never know the value of the const int unless we execute the function.
   Thus, it cannot be used as a case label.
b. Compiler will check that no assignment is made to a const.
   const is read-only variable.
c. const is subject to the same scope rules as variables.
d. const can be of any type.
