Assuming `T` is the name of a type, explain the difference between a function declared as `void f(T)` and `void f(T&)`.

* Function declared as `void f(T)`
    `T` argument is passed as a value, thus the value is **copied**.<br>
    You can utilize the value that is passed, but you cannot change it.

* Function declared as `void f(T&)`
    Argument is a reference to type `T` variable, thus the value is **referenced**.<br>
    You can change its value by its reference.
