## 047. Define and initialize member variables in the same order.

## 048. Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors.

## 049. Avoid calling virtual functions in constructors and destructors.

## 050. Make base class destructors public and virtual, or protected and nonvirtual.

## 051. Destructors, deallocation, and swap never fail.

## 052. Copy and destroy consistently.

## 053. Explicitly enable or disable copying.

## 054. Avoid slicing. Consider Clone instead of copying in base classes.

## 055. Prefer the canonical form of assignment.

## 056. Whenever it makes sense, provide a no-fail swap (and provide it correctly).
