## 032. Be clear what kind of class you're writing.
## 033. Prefer minimal classes to monolithic classes.
## 034. Prefer composition to inheritance.
## 035. Avoid inheriting from classes that were not designed to be base classes.
## 036. Prefer providing abstract interfaces.
## 037. Public inheritance is substitutability. Inherit, not to reuse, but to be reused.
## 038. Practice safe overriding.
## 039. Consider making virtual functions nonpublic, and public functions nonvirtual.
## 040. Avoid providing implicit conversions.
## 041. Make data members private, except in behaviorless aggregates (C-style structs).
## 042. Don't give away your internals.
## 043. Pimpl judiciously.
## 044. Prefer writing nonmember nonfriend functions.
## 045. Always provide new and delete together.
## 046. If you provide any class-specific new, provide all of the standard forms (plain, in-place, and nothrow).
