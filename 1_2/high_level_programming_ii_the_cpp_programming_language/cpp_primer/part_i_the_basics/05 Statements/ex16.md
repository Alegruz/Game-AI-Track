The while loop is particularly good at executing while some condition holds;<br>
for example, when we need to read values until end-of-file.<br>
The for loop is generally thought of as a step loop:
* An index steps through a range of values in a collection.

Write **an idiomatic use of each loop** and then **rewrite each using the other loop construct**.<br>
If you could use only one loop, which would you choose? Why?

## Idiomatic use of each loop
```
while (condition != false)
    statement
```

```
for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i)
    statement
```

```
for (auto elem : iteration)
    statement
```

## Rewriting loops
```
for (;condition != false;)
    statement
```

```
int i = 0;
while (i < size) {
    statements
    ++i;
}
```

```
auto iter = iteration.begin();
while (iter != iteration.end()) {
    statements
    ++iter;
}
```

## Personal Choice
Even when I need neverending loops, I use:
```
for (;;)
    statement
```

But, when I am constructing game logics, game loops, game updates, I prefer `while` loops.
