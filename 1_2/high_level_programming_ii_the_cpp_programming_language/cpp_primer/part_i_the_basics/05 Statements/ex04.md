Explain each of the following examples, and correct any problems you detect.

(a) ```
    while (string::iterator iter != s.end()) { /* . . . */ }
    ```
defining uninitialized variable then using it as an operand directly to a logical operator is impossible.


(b) ```
    while (bool status = find(word)) { /* . . . */ }
    if (!status) { /* . . . */ }
    ```

`status` is defined in `while` scope.<br>
Thus, `if` statement below knows nothing about undeclared variable `status`.
