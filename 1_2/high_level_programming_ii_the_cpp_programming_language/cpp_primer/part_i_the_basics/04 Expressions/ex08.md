Explain when operands are evaluated in the logical AND , logical OR , and equality operators.

`expr1 && expr2`<br>
`expr1` is evaluated, if `expr1` is `true`, then `expr2` is evaluated.<br>
if `expr1` is `false`, entire logical expression is `false`.

`expr1 || expr2`<br>
`expr1` is evaluated, if `expr1` is `true`, then entire logical expression is `true`.<br>
if `expr1` is `false`, then `expr2` is evaluated.

`expr1 == expr2`<br>
if value of `expr1` and `expr2` are equal, then the logical expression is `true`.<br>
precedence of evaluation is undefined.
