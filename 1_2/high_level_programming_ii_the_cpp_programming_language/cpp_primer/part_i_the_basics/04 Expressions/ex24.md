Our program that distinguished between high pass, pass, and fail depended on the fact that the conditional operator is right associative.<br>
Describe how that operator would be evaluated if the operator were left associative.

```
expr1 ? expr2 : expr3 ? expr4 : expr5 ? expr6 : expr7
```
1. `expr1` is evaluated, if it is nonzero, `expr2` is the rvalue.
2. if `expr1` is zero, then `expr2` is discarded, `expr3` is the rvalue
3. which means, the expression above is as follows:
```
((expr1 ? expr2 : expr3) ? expr4 : expr5) ? expr6 : expr7
```
