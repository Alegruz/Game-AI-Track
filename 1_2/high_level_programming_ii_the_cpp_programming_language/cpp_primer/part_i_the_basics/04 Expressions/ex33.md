Using Table 4.12 (p. 166) explain what the following expression does:<br>

`someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x, --y`<br>
put `x` 3, `y` 2.<br>
1. `,` operator has lower precedence than conditional operator. >> `(someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x), --y`  
2. if `someValue` is true, `++x, ++y` is evaluated. `x` is 4, `y` is 3.
3. else, `--x` is evaluated. `x` is 2, `y` is 2.
4. then `--y` is performed.
