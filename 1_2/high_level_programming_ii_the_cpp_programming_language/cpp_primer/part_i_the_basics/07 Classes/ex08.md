Why does `read` define its `Sales_data` parameter as a plain reference and `print` define its parameter as a reference to `const`?

1. Why does `read` define its `Sales_data` parameter as a plain reference?
    * Because function `read` changes object's data. It reads input then changes the value of the `Sales_data` object.

2. Why does `print` define its parameter as a reference to `const`?
    * `print` function doesn't change object's data, it just shows the data.
