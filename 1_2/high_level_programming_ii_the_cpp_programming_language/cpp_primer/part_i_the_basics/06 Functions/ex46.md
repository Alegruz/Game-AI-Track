Would it be possible to define `isShorter` as a `constexpr`?<br>
If so, do so. If not, explain why not.

```
bool isShorter(const string &s1, const string &s2) {
    return s1.size() < s2.size();
}
```

* `constexpr` function should include statements that generates no actions at runtime.
* `.size()` function is an action that runs during runtime.
* `isShorter` can't be defined as a `constexpr`
