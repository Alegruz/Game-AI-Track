Which, if any, of the following calls are illegal? Why?<br>
Which, if any, are legal but unlikely to match the programmerâ€™s intent? Why?

```
char *init(int ht, int wd = 80, char bckgrnd = ' ');
```

(a) `init();`
illegal. argument for `ht` missing

(b) `init(24,10);`
legal.

(c) `init(14, '*');`
legal, but not programmer's intent.<br>
Second argument `'*'` is intended to be a `char`, not `int`, which is the second paramter of `init`.
