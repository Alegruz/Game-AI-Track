Given the following declarations, determine which calls are legal and which are illegal.<br>
For those that are illegal, explain why.

```
double calc(double);
int count(const string &, char);
int sum(vector<int>::iterator, vector<int>::iterator, int);
vector<int> vec(10);
```

(a) `calc(23.4, 55.1);`<br>
illegal. too many arguments.

(b) `count("abcda", 'a');`<br>
legal.

(c) `calc(66);`<br>
legal.

(d) `sum(vec.begin(), vec.end(), 3.8);`
legal.
