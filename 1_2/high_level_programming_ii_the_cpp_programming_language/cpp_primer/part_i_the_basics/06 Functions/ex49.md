What is a candidate function? What is a viable function?

* **candidate function**: function with the same name as the called function and for which a declaration is visible at the point of the call.
* **viable function**: function that has the same number of parameters as there are arguments in the call, and the types of each arguments must match-or be convertible to-the type of its corresponding parameter.
