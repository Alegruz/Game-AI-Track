1. When should reference parameters be references to `const`?
    1. when we need literals / both `const` and non`const` as arguments
    2. when we are sure that we are not going to change the value of the argument

2. What happens if we make a parameter a plain reference when it could be a reference to `const`?
    1. literals / `const` might not be accepted as arguments
    2. value might be changed which is not what we anticipated
