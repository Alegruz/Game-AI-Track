Explain the behavior of the following function.<br>
If there are problems in the code, explain what they are and how you might fix them.

```
void print(const int ia[10])
{
    for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
        cout << ia[i] << endl;
}
```

* `ia[10]` doesn't indicate that the argument is necessarily an array with 10 integers. thus second condition of `for` statement might cause trouble.
```
void print(const int (&arr)[10]) {
    for (auto elem : arr)
        cout << elem << endl;
}
```
