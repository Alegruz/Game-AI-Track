Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid?
If they are valid, explain what they do.

int i = 0, &r1 = i; double d = 0, &r2 = d;

(a) r2 = 3.14159;
(b) r2 = r1;

r2 == 0.0

(c) i = r2;

implicit conversion from double to int
i == 0

(d) r1 = d;

implicit conversion from double to int
r1 == 0
