(a) int i, *const cp;
uninitialized int variable i defined.

illegal.
const pointer to int cp defined but uninitialized.

(b) int *p1, *const p2;
uninitialized pointer to int p1 defined.

illegal
const pointer to int p2 defined but initialized.

(c) const int ic, &r = ic;
illegal.
const int ic uninitialized.

legal.
r, initialized reference to const int, references const int ic defined.

(d) const int *const p3;
p3, const pointer to const int, defined but uninitialized.

(e) const int *p;
