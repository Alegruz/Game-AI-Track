Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those
using a while. Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?

for: useful when used with "counting variables". except for special cases where the loop contains "continue", while can be translated into for.
    if number of controlling variables or conditions increase, it becomes hard to read.
    ex) counting

while: useful when used with loops that has no ranges. the loop shall end when the programmer says so.
    not really the best choice when it comes to loops with ranges.
    ex) game loop
