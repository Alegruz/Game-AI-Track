When are `friend`s useful?<br>
Discuss the pros and cons of using `friend`s.

* If you need a `class` that needs to be encapsulated, but at the same time another `class` or function needs to access to its non`public` member, you use `friend`.
* **PRO**
    * We can create interface functions that are not a part of the `class`.
    * You can access non`public` members without using member functions of the `class`.
* **CON**
    * If you misuse them, encapsulation might become meaningless.
    * If you change the `class`, especially its non`public` members, probably you should also change your `friend` functions/`class`es.
