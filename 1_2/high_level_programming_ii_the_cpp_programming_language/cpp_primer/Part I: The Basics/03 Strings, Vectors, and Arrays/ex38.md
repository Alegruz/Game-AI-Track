In this section, we noted that it was not only illegal but meaningless to try to add two pointers.<br>
Why would adding two pointers be meaningless?

pointer is an address.<br>
you will be mostly interested in relations between pointers, which are distance between pointers and so on.<br>
say that we have two pointer with their respective address: `001`, `011`. (let's say the type it is pointing to is a bit big)<br>
if we subtract them, we get `010`, which definitely is inside the bound if the two pointers are elements of an array.<br>
if we add them, we get `100`, which is out of bound.<br>
Useless.
