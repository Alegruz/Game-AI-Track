## List some of the drawbacks of using an array instead of a vector.

* if you need to expand your array, that might be a problem if you are using an array
* if you need to use an iterator
* if you need to assign / copy your data, you need vector
* size of your array must be defined in compile time.
* if you're making a string out of array, you need to include null character at the end.
* you are the one that has to track the size of the array, not the array itself. (no `size()` member function)
