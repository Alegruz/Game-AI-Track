Explain what this loop does and whether it is a good use of `assert`:

```
string s;
while (cin >> s && s != sought) { }  // empty body
assert(cin);
```

The program will continue to receive input until `s` has the same value as `sought`.<br>
There will be some form of input stream into `cin` anyways, thus using `assert()` to `cin` is meaningless.<br>
When `cin` receives an invalid input, the test will fail.<br>
Now we want to tell the user that the test failed, our `s` is not `sought`.<br>
Thus, `assert(s == sought)` would be better use of `assert` in this snippet.
