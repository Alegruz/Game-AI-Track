## Best Practices
The header that declares a function should be included in the source file that defines that function.

## Best Practices
Programmers accustomed to programming in C often use pointer parameters to access objects outside a function.<br>
In C++, programmers generally use reference parameters instead.

## Best Practices
Reference parameters that are not changed inside a function should be references to `const`.
