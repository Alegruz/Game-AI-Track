What would happen if the stopping condition in `factorial` were `if (val != 0)`

```
// calculate val!, which is 1 * 2 * 3 . . . * val
int factorial(int val)
{
    if (val != 0)
        return factorial(val-1) * val;
    return 1;
}
```

* `val` is postive: 1 * 1 * 2 * 3 . . . will be calculated
* `val` is negative: recursive loop occurs. STACK OVERFLOW
