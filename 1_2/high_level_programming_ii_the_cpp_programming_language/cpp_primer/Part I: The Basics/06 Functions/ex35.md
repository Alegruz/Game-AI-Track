In the call to fact, why did we pass `val - 1` rather than `val--`?

1. `val--` means that we will be always passing `val` as the argument, causing recursive loops. STACK OVERFLOW! 
2. Even though we are planning to use `--val`, increment / decrement operators work in unexpected ways. We can't be 100% sure whether `--val` works because it's behavior depends on the compiler. It is safer to use `val-1` even though `--val` works in your compiler, in your device.
