Which one of the following declarations and definitions would you put in a header?<br>
In a source file? Explain why.

(a) `inline bool eq(const BigInt&, const BigInt&) {...}`
HEADER.<br>
`inline` functions are normally defined in headers because
all of the definitions of a given `inline` must match exactly.

(b) `void putValues(int *arr, int size);`
SOURCE FILE or HEADER.<br>
Depends on your program's design. If `putValues` function is reusable in other files, then header would be better.
