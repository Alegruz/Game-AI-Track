What is a “dangling else”?<br>
How are else clauses resolved in C++?

## **dangling else**<br>
Consider the following example:
```
if (y != 0)
    if (x != 0)
        result = x / y;
else
    cout << "Error: y is equal to 0 << endl;
```
To which `if` statement does the `else` clause belong?<br>
The indentation suggests that it belongs to the outer `if` statement.<br>
However, C++ follows the rule that an `else` clause belongs to the nearest `if` statement that hasn't already been paired with an `else`<br>
To resolve the issue, simply add blocks.
```
if (y != 0) {
    if (x != 0)
        result = x / y;
} else
    cout << "Error: y is equal to 0 << endl;
```
