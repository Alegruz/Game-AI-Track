Explain the key differences between pointers and references.

pointers: points to a type
            is an object in its own right
            can be assigned and copied
            can point to several different objects
            need not be initialized when defined

references: reference to an object
            another name of already existing object
            becomes bound to its initializer
            remains bound to its initial object
            must be initialized
