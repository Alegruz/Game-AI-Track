Given the declarations in the previous exercise determine whether the following assignments are legal.
Explain how the top-level or low-level const applies in each case.

const int v2 = 0;
int v1 = v2;
int *p1 = &v1, &r1 = v1;
const int *p2 = &v2, *const p3 = &i, &r2 = v2;

r1 = v2;
legal.
const int v2 assigned to r1, reference to int v1.
(top-level)

p1 = p2;
illegal.
p2, pointer to const int, assigned to p1, pointer to int.
(low-level nonconst pointing const)

p2 = p1;
legal.
p1, pointer to int, assigned to p2, pointer to const int.
(int * converted to const int *)
(low-level)

p1 = p3;
illegal.
p3, const pointer to const int, assigned to p1, pointer to int.
(low-level nonconst pointing const)

p2 = p3;
legal.
p3, const pointer to const int, assigned to p2, pointer to const int.
(low-level)
