For each of the following declarations indicate whether the object being declared has top-level or low-level const.

const int v2 = 0;
v2: top-level const.

int v1 = v2;

int *p1 = &v1, &r1 = v1;
reference to int v1 assigned to p1, pointer to int
r1, reference to int references int v1.

const int *p2 = &v2, *const p3 = &i, &r2 = v2;
p2: pointer to low-level const int
p3: top-level const pointer to low-level const int
r2: reference to low-level const int
reference to const int v2 assigned to p2, low-level const. pointer to const int
reference to int i assigned to p3, low-level const pointer to top-level const int. (int * is converted to const int*)
const int v2, assigned to r2, reference to low-level const int.
