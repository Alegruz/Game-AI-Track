Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left undefined to give the compiler opportunities for optimization.<br>
This strategy presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in the use of the language by the programmer.<br>
Do you consider that an acceptable trade-off?<br>
Why or why not?

I consider this an acceptable trade-off.<br>
If daily operators such as binary operators impose set of stringent, implicit rules, that makes them even harder to use.<br>
Everything can be solved by parentheses, no?<br>
Well, of course other binary operators other than common arithmetic ones such as relational operators might certainly need some set of rules.
