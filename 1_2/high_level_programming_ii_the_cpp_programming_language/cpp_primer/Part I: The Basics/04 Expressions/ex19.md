Given that `ptr` points to an `int`,<br>
that `vec` is a `vector<int>`,<br>
and that `ival` is an `int`,<br>
explain the behavior of each of these expressions.<br>
Which, if any, are likely to be incorrect?<br>
Why? How might each be corrected?

(a) `ptr != 0 && *ptr++`<br>
if `ptr` is not a null pointer, and the its value is nonzero<br>
then increment the value.
```
if (ptr != 0 && *ptr != 0)
    *ptr++;
```

(b) `ival++ && ival`<br>
if `ival` and incremented `ival` is nonzero.<br>
```
ival && (ival + 1)
```

(c) `vec[ival++] <= vec[ival]`<br>
if element in index `ival` is lesser than the element next to it.<br>
```
vec[ival] <= vec[ival + 1]
```
