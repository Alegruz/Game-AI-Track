Given the following definitions,
```
char cval;     int ival;    unsigned int ui;
float fval;    double dval;
```
identify the implicit type conversions, if any, taking place:

(a) `cval = 'a' + 3;`<br>
`char = char + int`<br>
`char = int + int` `char` to `int` promotion<br>
`char = int`<br>
`char = char` `int` converted to `char`

(b) `fval = ui - ival * 1.0;`<br>
`float = unsigned int - int * double`<br>
`float = unsigend int - double * double` `int` promoted to `double`<br>
`float = unsigned int - double`<br>
`float = double - double` `unsigned int` promoted to `double`. depends on the size of `unsigned int`<br>
`float = double`<br>
`float = float` `double` truncated to `float`

(c) `dval = ui * fval;`<br>
`double = unsigned int * float`<br>
`double = float * float` `unsigned int` promoted to `float`. depends on the size of `unsigned int`<br>
`double = float`<br>
`double = double` `float` promoted to `double`

(d) `cval = ival + fval + dval;`<br>
`char = int + float + double`<br>
`char = float + float + double` `int` promoted to `float`<br>
`char = float + double`<br>
`char = double + double` `float` promoted to `double`<br>
`char = double`<br>
`char = char` `double` converted to `char`
