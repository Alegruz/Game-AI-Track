Although the following are legal, they probably do not behave as the programmer expects.<br>
Why? Rewrite the expressions as you think they should be.

(a) `if (p = getPtr() != 0)`<br>
`if ((p = getPtr()) != 0)`<br>
get a pointer, and check if it is a null pointer.

(b) `if (i = 1024)`<br>
`if (i == 1024)`<br>
check is `i` is equal to `1024`
