Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what conversions take place in the following expressions:
```
bool      flag;         char           cval;
short     sval;         unsigned short usval;
int       ival;         unsigned int   uival;
long      lval;         unsigned long  ulval;
float     fval;         double         dval;
```

(a) `if (fval)`<br>
`if (float)` but if needs bool.<br>
`fval` truncated to `int`<br>
if truncated `fval` is nonzero, then `true`. else, `false`

(b) `dval = fval + ival;`<br>
`double = float + int`<br>
`double = float + float` `int` to `float` promotion<br>
`double = float`<br>
`double = double` `float` to `double` promotion<br>

(c) `dval + ival * cval;`<br>
`double + int * char`<br>
`double + int * int` `char` to `int` promotion<br>
`double + int` if `int` * `int`<br>
`double + double` `int` to `double` promotion<br>

Remember that you may need to consider the associativity of the operators.
