Explain the following expression:

`double slope = static_cast<double>(j/i);`<br>
`double = static_cast<double>(int / int);`<br>
`double = static_cast<double>(int);`<br>
`double = double;`

You can tell that we all know this isn't what the programmer wants to happen.<br>
It is basically the same as `double slope = j / i;`.
