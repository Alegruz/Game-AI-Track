Assuming that `iter` is a `vector<string>::iterator`, indicate which, if any, of the following expressions are legal.<br>
Explain the behavior of the legal expressions and why those that arenâ€™t legal are in error.

(a) `*iter++`;
legal.<br>
`*` precedes `++`.<br>
increment `iter` return copied original version of `*iter`.

(b) `(*iter)++;`<br>
illegal.<br>
`std::string` does not have postfix operator.

(c) `*iter.empty()`<br>
illegal.<br>
member function call precedes `*`.<br>
`iter` has no member function `empty()`.

(d) `iter->empty();`<br>
legal.<br>
`*iter` has member function `empty()`

(e) `++*iter;`<br>
legal.<br>
increment `*iter`, and return incremented itself.

(f) `iter++->empty();`<br>
legal.<br>
first, `iter->empty()` is evaluated, then postfix operator advanced `iter`.
